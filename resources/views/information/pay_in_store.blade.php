         Check out the products you want to buy and select your preferred payment method. There will be two options of payment: pay cash at cashier or pay online.
         If you choose to pay cash, please show the barcode to the cashier. You will get this barcode right after submitting the order. The payment status will be updated after the payment is successful. If there is no payment within 24 hours since the purchase being made, the order will be canceled automatically through the system.
